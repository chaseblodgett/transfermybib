If you're a runner who participates in many road races like me, youâ€™ve probably experienced the painful process of getting injured right before a big race or realizing that was the ONE weekend you are out town after signing up for the race months in advance. How will you find someone last minute to buy your bib? Who do you even know is running that race? Or maybe there was that one race next year that you really wanted to run, but's been sold out since a week after registration opened :(. How will you find someone willing to sell their bib to you? This is a situation that many avid runners find themselves in year after year. After struggling with this myself a couple times, I decided there should be an easier way to connect with others in a similar situation. Inspired by the difficulty and inaccesabilty of finding others to buy/sell race bibs, I have created TransferMyBib. Built using React.js, Express.js and MongoDB, runners can easily find and connect with others willing to buy/sell their race bibs.
