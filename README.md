# TransferMyBib 

## Source code for TransferMyBib web app

#### Designed for users who are looking for an easy interface to buy or sell bibs for various races across the US. Inspired by the inaccessability and difficulty of finding last minutes bibs to sold out races or trying to sell bibs for races you will not run. Users can make posts about selling/buying bibs in different chats, making it easier to go through this process and find others willing to buy/sell bibs for a specific race. Built using React for the frontend and Express.js/MongoDB for the backend.
